<h1 align="center"> SQL Injection </h1>






# Task 1: Brief

## What is SQL?
**SQL (Structured Query Language)**: is a programming language used to manage and interact with relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.). Web applications often use SQL to:
- Store user data (e.g., usernames, passwords, emails)
- Retrieve information (e.g., product listings, user profiles)
- Update or delete records

## What Going on
A **Database** is like a big filing cabinet that stores usernames, passwords, and customer info.
**SQL** is the language websites use to talk to that filing cabinet.
**SQL Injection (SQLi)** happens when a hacker sneaks bad instructions into that conversation.

# Task 2: What is a Database?


## What is a Database?
- A **database** is like a digital filing cabinet where information is stored in an organized way.
- It’s managed by a **DBMS (Database Management System)**, which is the software that helps you create, read, update, and delete data.


### Two Main Types of Databases
- **Relational databases**: Store data in **tables** (like spreadsheets). Examples: MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite.
- **Non-relational databases**: Store data in other formats (like documents or key-value pairs). Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra.

#### Example: Online Shop Database
Imagine you run an online shop. You create a database called shop. Inside it, you make tables for different kinds of data:

- **Products table** → items you sell
- **Users table** → people who sign up
- **Orders table** → purchases made

Each table has a **unique name** and stores related information separately, keeping things neat.

### Why is it dangerous?
If a website doesn’t check or clean user input properly, the attacker can:
- **Steal** sensitive data (like passwords, credit cards, personal info)
- **Delete or change** data in the database
- **Bypass** login and access admin or private areas

Because of this, SQLi is one of the oldest, most common, and most harmful web vulnerabilities.

## What are Table?
- A **Table** is like a spreadsheet in Excel or Google Sheets.
- It organizes data into a grid made of columns and rows.


### Break down:
- **Columns (the labels at the top)**
  - Think of them as categories.
  - Example: `ID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Age`.
  - Each column only holds one type of data (numbers, text, dates).

- **Rows (the entries going down)**
  - Each row is one record (like one person or one product).
  - Example:
    - Row 1 → `1, Alice, alice@email.com, 25`
    - Row 2 → `2, Bob, bob@email.com, 30`

- **Cells (the little boxes)**
  - A cell is where a column and row meet.
  - Example: In Row 2 under the `Name column` → `Bob`.

## What is a Column (Field)?
A column (also called a field) is a vertical part of a database table.
- Each column stores one type of information
- Every column has a unique name within its table

Example table: `users`
| id | username | email | created_date |
| -- | -------- | ----- | ------------ |

Here:
- `id`, `username`, `email`, `created_date` are columns
- Each column represents a specific kind of data



### Column Names Must Be Unique
Inside one table:
- We **cannot** have two columns with the same name
- This prevents confusion when querying data

Valid:
````
id, name, email
````



### Data Types: What Can a Column Store?
When you create a column, you must define its data type.
This tells the database what kind of data is allowed.

#### Common Data Types
| Data Type          | Description    | Example          |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| `INT`              | Whole numbers  | 1, 25, 500       |
| `VARCHAR` / `TEXT` | Text (strings) | "hello", "John"  |
| `DATE`             | Date only      | 2026-01-14       |
| `DATETIME`         | Date + time    | 2026-01-14 15:30 |



### Why Data Types Are Important
- Data types protect data integrity.
- If a column is meant for dates:
````
created_date DATE
````
Allowed:
````
2026-01-14
````
Not allowed:
````
"hello world"
````


### Complex Data Types
Some databases support advanced data types such as:
- **Geospatial data** → latitude/longitude, maps
- **JSON** → structured data
- **Binary data** → files, images



### Auto-Increment Columns
An auto-increment column automatically generates a number for each new row.

Example:
````
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
````
What happens:
- First row → `id = 1`
- Second row → ``id = 2``
- Third row → ``id = 3``

We don’t need to insert the number manually.


### What is a Key Field?
A key field is a column that uniquely identifies each row.

- Most commonly:
  - An auto-increment integer
  - Known as a Primary Key

- Why it must be unique:
  - No two rows can have the same key value
  - Makes every row easy to find

Example:
````
| id | username |
| -- | -------- |
| 1  | Alice    |
| 2  | Bob      |
````
- `id` is the key field
- `id = 2` refers to exactly one row



### Using the Key Field in SQL Queries
Because the key field is unique, it’s perfect for searching.
````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 2;
````
- Finds **one specific** row
- Is fast and reliable



## Rows:
Rows or records contain individual lines of data. When you add data to the table, a new row/record is created; when you delete data, a row/record is removed.


## Relational Databases (RDB)
- Think of them like **spreadsheets**.
- Data is stored in **tables** (rows and columns).
- Each table has a **primary key** (unique ID).
- Tables can be linked together using these keys → that’s why they’re called relational.
- Examples: `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQL Server`, `SQLite`.



## Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
- Think of them like a **flexible notebook**.
- They don’t use strict tables with rows and columns.
- Each entry can look different (no fixed layout).
- Great for handling **big data** or **unstructured data** (like logs, social media posts, sensor data).
- Examples: **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, **ElasticSearch**.

# Task 3: What is SQL?

## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language): SQL is a language for talking to databases. We use it to get data, add new data, change existing data, and remove data. These actions are done with statements.


## Select 





### 1. Select all columns from a table

``select * from users;``

| ID | Username | Password  |
| -- | -------- | --------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123   |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword  |
| 3  | martin   | secret123 |

Here’s a short and simple summary:
- `SELECT * FROM users;`: gets **all columns** (id, username, password) from the users table.
- `SELECT username, password FROM users;`: gets **only the username and password columns** from the users table.
- **Semicolon (;)**: marks the end of the query.



### 2. Select specific columns
````
select username,password from users;
````
| Username | Password  |
| -------- | --------- |
| jon      | pass123   |
| admin    | p4ssword  |
| martin   | secret123 |

- Only returns the `username` and `password` columns (no `id`)



### 3. Limit Results
````
select * from users LIMIT 1;
````
| ID | Username | Password |
| -- | -------- | -------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123  |

- `LIMIT 1`: show only the first row.

Or:
````
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1,1;
````
- Skip 1 row, then show 1 row.

````
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 2,1;
````
- Skip 2 rows, then show 1 row.

- **Rule**: `LIMIT skip, show` → first number = how many to skip, second = how many to show.



### 4. Filter with WHERE
````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';
````
| ID | Username | Password |
| -- | -------- | -------- |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword |

- Only shows rows where username is `admin`.

OR: 
````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username != 'admin';
````
| ID | Username | Password  |
| -- | -------- | --------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123   |
| 3  | martin   | secret123 |

- Shows rows where username is `not` admin.



````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR username = 'jon';
````
| ID | Username | Password |
| -- | -------- | -------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123  |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword |

- Shows rows where username is admin OR jon.


````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'p4ssword';
````
| ID | Username | Password |
| -- | -------- | -------- |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword |

- Shows rows where username is `admin AND password is p4ssword`.



### 5. Pattern Matching with LIKE
````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'a%';
````
| ID | Username | Password |
| -- | -------- | -------- |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword |

- ``a%``: usernames starting with `a`.


````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%n';
````
| ID | Username | Password  |
| -- | -------- | --------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123   |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword  |
| 3  | martin   | secret123 |

- `%n`: usernames ending with `n`.
- Result: `jon`, `admin`, `martin`.

````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%mi%';
````
| ID | Username | Password |
| -- | -------- | -------- |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword |

- `%mi%`: usernames containing `mi`.
- Result: `admin`.

#### Summery 
- **SELECT \***: get all columns.
- **SELECT column1, column2**: get only chosen columns.
- **LIMIT skip, show**: control how many rows you see.
- **WHERE**: filter results by condition.
- **LIKE with %**: search for patterns (starts, ends, contains).

## Onion 

### What is UNION?
- The UNION operator combines the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

- Think of it like stacking two lists on top of each other—but with strict rules!


### UNION in SQL
- UNION combines results from two or more SELECT queries into one list.
- Rules:
  - Each SELECT must return the same number of columns.
  - The columns must be in the same order.
  - The data types must match (e.g., text with text, numbers with numbers).


- `UNION` = merge results together.


### Rules for Using UNION
To use `UNION`, your queries must follow these rules:

- Same number of columns in each `SELECT`.
- Matching data types in corresponding columns (e.g., text with text, numbers with numbers).
- Same column order (so the meaning stays consistent).


### Easy Analogy
- Imagine a company wants one mailing list for both customers and suppliers.
  - **Customers table**: has addresses.
  - **Suppliers table**: also has addresses.
  - Using **UNION**, you can merge both lists into **one combined list**.

| ID | Name             | Address         | City       | Postcode |
| -- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1  | Mr John Smith    | 123 Fake Street | Manchester | M2 3FJ   |
| 2  | Mrs Jenny Palmer | 99 Green Road   | Birmingham | B2 4KL   |
| 3  | Miss Sarah Lewis | 15 Fore Street  | London     | NW12 3GH |

- And another called suppliers with the following contents:



| ID | Company          | Address                     | City    | Postcode |
| -- | ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 1  | Widgets Ltd      | Unit 1a, Newby Estate       | Bristol | BS19 4RT |
| 2  | The Tool Company | 75 Industrial Road          | Norwich | N22 3DR  |
| 3  | Axe Makers Ltd   | 2b Makers Unit, Market Road | London  | SE9 1KK  |

- Using the following SQL Statement, we can gather the results from the two tables and put them into one result set:

````
SELECT name,address,city,postcode from customers UNION SELECT company,address,city,postcode from suppliers;
````
| Name / Company   | Address                     | City       | Postcode |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Mr John Smith    | 123 Fake Street             | Manchester | M2 3FJ   |
| Mrs Jenny Palmer | 99 Green Road               | Birmingham | B2 4KL   |
| Miss Sarah Lewis | 15 Fore Street              | London     | NW12 3GH |
| Widgets Ltd      | Unit 1a, Newby Estate       | Bristol    | BS19 4RT |
| The Tool Company | 75 Industrial Road          | Norwich    | N22 3DR  |
| Axe Makers Ltd   | 2b Makers Unit, Market Road | London     | SE9 1KK  |


## INSERT

### What The INSERT does?
- The INSERT statement adds a new row of data into a table.
- Think of it like writing a new entry into a spreadsheet.


````
insert into users (username,password) values ('bob','password123');
````
| ID | Username | Password    |
| -- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123     |
| 2  | admin    | p4ssword    |
| 3  | martin   | secret123   |
| 4  | bob      | password123 |


## UPDATE

- **UPDATE table**: tells the database which table you want to change.
**Example**: UPDATE users

- **SET column=value**: specifies which fields to update and their new values.
Example: `SET username='root'`, `password='pass123'`

- **WHERE condition**: chooses which rows to update (otherwise all rows will change).
Example: `WHERE username='admin'`

````
update users SET username='root',password='pass123' where username='admin';
````
| ID | Username | Password    |
| -- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123     |
| 2  | root     | pass123     |
| 3  | martin   | secret123   |
| 4  | bob      | password123 |




## DELETE
- **DELETE FROM table**: removes rows from a table.
- **WHERE condition**: chooses which rows to delete (without it, all rows will be deleted).
- **LIMIT number**: controls how many rows to delete.

| ID | Username | Password    |
| -- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1  | jon      | pass123     |
| 2  | root     | pass123     |
| 4  | bob      | password123 |

````
delete from users;
````
- Because no WHERE clause was being used in the query, all the data was deleted from the table.

| ID | Username | Password |
| -- | -------- | -------- |
