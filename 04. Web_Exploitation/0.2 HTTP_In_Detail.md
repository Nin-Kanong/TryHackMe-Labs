# Task 1: What is HTTP(S) 
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: The basic set of rules for transferring web pages and resources (like text, images, videos) between your browser and a web server.

- **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)**: The encrypted version of HTTP. It protects your data from being read or altered in transit and verifies you’re connected to the real server, not an imposter.
- Think of HTTPS as HTTP + security (encryption + authentication).

# Task 2: Requests And Responses:
## What is a URL?
A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is basically the "address" of something on the internet. It tells your browser how to access a resource (like a webpage, image, or file) and where to find it.


## Structure of a URL
A URL can have several parts, though not all are always used:
- Protocol → `http://` or `https://` Tells the browser how to communicate (secure or not).
- Domain name → `www.example.com` The server you’re connecting to.
- Port (optional) → `:80` or `:443` Specifies the network port (defaults are usually implied).
- Path → `/images/photo.jpg` The location of the resource on the server.
- Query string (optional) → `?id=123&sort=asc` Extra parameters sent to the server.
- Fragment (optional) → `#section2` Points to a specific part of the page


- Example: 
````
https://www.example.com:443/products/item?id=123#reviews
````
- `https://` → protocol
- `www.example.com` → domain
- `:443` → port
- `/products/item` → path
- `?id=123` → query string
- `#reviews` → fragment


<img width="1140" height="270" alt="34ad66d8b90aaaa35f9536d3b152ea97" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb07c35-3999-4494-a55e-62c62b5881ef" />


### Part of a URL
| URL Part     | What It Is        | Simple Explanation                                        | Example                           |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Scheme       | Protocol used     | Tells the browser which protocol to use                   | `https://`, `http://`, `ftp://`   |
| User         | User credentials  | Allows username (and sometimes password) in the URL       | `ftp://user:password@host.com/`   |
| Host         | Server address    | Domain name or IP of the server                           | `www.example.com`, `192.168.1.10` |
| Port         | Service number    | Specifies which service to connect to (default or custom) | `:80`, `:443`, `:8080`            |
| Path         | Resource location | Points to a file or page on the server                    | `/blog/article.html`              |
| Query String | Extra parameters  | Sends extra data to the server                            | `?id=1`, `?q=linux&page=2`        |
| Fragment     | Page section      | Jumps to a specific part of a page                        | `#section2`                       |



### Example:
````
https://user:pass@www.example.com:443/blog?id=1#comments
````
- Scheme: `https://`
- User: `user:pass`
- Host: `www.example.com`
- Port: `443`
- Path: `/blog`
- Query String: `id=1`
- Fragment: `#comments`

#### Making a Request
It's possible to make a request to a web server with just one line GET / HTTP/1.1 
<img width="1140" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de549a6d-1e33-431f-adcb-45f4487a4f99" />


- To make web communication richer, browsers don’t just send the main request.
- They also send headers, which are small pieces of extra information.
- Headers tell the server details like who’s sending the request, what format is expected, or authentication info.
- headers = extra data that helps the server understand and respond properly.

**Example Request**:
````
GET / HTTP/1.1

Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/
````

- **Line 1**: `GET / HTTP/1.1`: This request is using the GET method to ask the server for the home page (/). It also tells the server we’re speaking the HTTP protocol version 1.1.

- **Line 2**: `Host: tryhackme.com`: We tell the web server that the website we want is tryhackme.com. This is required in HTTP/1.1 because one server can host many websites.

- **Line 3**: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0` We tell the web server that we are using the Firefox browser, version 87. This helps the server know what kind of client is making the request.

- **Line 4**: `Referer: https://tryhackme.com/`: We are telling the web server that the page which referred us (the page we came from) is https://tryhackme.com/. This is used for analytics and sometimes for security checks.

- **Line 5**: (blank line): HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request is finished and no more headers are coming.


### Example:
````
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98


<html>
<head>
    <title>TryHackMe</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome To TryHackMe.com
</body>
</html>
````

Breakdown each line of the response:

- **Line 1**: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`: This shows the protocol version the server is using (HTTP/1.1) and the status code (200 OK). It means the request was successful and the server is sending back the requested page.

- **Line 2**: `Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`: This tells us the web server software and version number. In this example, it’s Apache running on Ubuntu.

- **Line 3**: `Date: Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:21:00 GMT`: This shows the current date, time, and timezone of the server when it sent the response.

- **Line 4**: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`: This header tells the client what type of content is being sent. Here it’s HTML text, but it could also be images, videos, PDFs, or XML depending on the request.

- **Line 5**: `Content-Length: 10240`: This tells the client how many bytes long the response body is. It helps the browser confirm that all the data was received and nothing is missing.

- **Line 6**:(blank line): HTTP responses always include a blank line after the headers. This signals the end of the header section and the start of the actual content.

- **Lines 7–14**: The response body — this is the actual information you asked for. In this case, it would be the HTML code for the homepage of the site.

## Question 1: What HTTP protocol is being used in the above example?
<img width="844" height="91" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7caa59-86d0-4152-8232-d04c37d309a1" />

- After view about `GET / HTTP/1.1`, now we found the HTTP protocol is being used in the above example:
````
HTTP/1.1
````
<img width="828" height="89" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/843fcce0-eb0d-4ac7-bd60-2311bc73e3db" />

- Now we see the correct answer.

# Task 3: HTTP Methods

**HTTP methods** are like ``verbs`` that tell a web server what action we want to perform. The most common ones are GET (fetch data), POST (send new data), PUT (update existing data), and DELETE (remove data)

- **GET**: ``Show me the book``
  - We’re asking the server to give you information.
  - **Example**: When we open a webpage, your browser sends a GET request to fetch the page content.

- **POST**: ``Add a new book to the library``
  - We’re sending data to the server, usually to create something new.
  - **Example**: Submitting a signup form creates a new user account.

- **PUT**: ``Replace this book with an updated version``
  - We’re updating existing data on the server.
  - **Example**: Editing your profile information updates your stored details.

- **DELETE**: ``Remove this book from the library``
  - We’re asking the server to delete something.
  - **Example**: Deleting a photo from your account removes it from the server.


| Method | Action               | Analogy                  | Example Use           |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| GET    | Retrieve data        | Borrowing a book         | Viewing a webpage     |
| POST   | Create new data      | Donating a new book      | Submitting a form     |
| PUT    | Update existing data | Replacing a book edition | Updating profile info |
| DELETE | Remove data          | Throwing away a book     | Deleting a comment    |

## Answer the questions below

### Question 1: What method would be used to create a new user account?
<img width="830" height="90" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abdc6ea2-5c60-4bda-8c4d-bcd8ee11b5a3" />

- `Create a new Users Account` is:
````
POST
````
Cause when we’re sending new data to the server (like our username, password, email) so the server can create a new record.
<img width="827" height="88" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de18bc70-4c62-4a39-ae2a-15aae0aa41ba" />


### Question 2: What method would be used to update your email address?

- `Update your email address` is:
````
PUT (or sometimes PATCH)
````
Cause when we’re modifying existing data. **PUT** usually replaces the whole record, while PATCH changes just part of it (like only the email field).
<img width="823" height="90" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9714105f-5887-4b2c-ac35-aa5f7a0d7e36" />

- `Remove a picture you’ve uploaded` is:
````
DELETE
````
Cause when we’re asking the server to delete a resource (our picture) from its database.
<img width="826" height="84" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f69167db-db36-486a-bf4d-6e0566bc5695" />

- ``View a news article`` is:
````
GET
````
Cause when we’re requesting information from the server without changing anything.
<img width="823" height="89" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee811c38-0e8c-404b-a909-54b5c6dde003" />

# Task 4: HTTP Status Code

### HTTP Sratus Code:
When we talk to a web server (like asking for a webpage), the server replies with a **status code** — `a 3-digit` number that tells us what happened. These codes are grouped into 5 ranges, kind of like traffic lights or signals.


| Status Code Range | Category                | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100–199           | Informational Responses | Sent to tell the client the first part of the request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest. These codes are now rarely used. |
| 200–299           | Success                 | Indicates that the client’s request was successfully received, understood, and processed.                                                           |
| 300–399           | Redirection             | Informs the client that the requested resource is located elsewhere, either on another page or a different website.                                 |
| 400–499           | Client Errors           | Indicates there was an issue with the client’s request (e.g., bad syntax or unauthorized access).                                                   |
| 500–599           | Server Errors           | Indicates an error occurred on the server side, usually signaling a serious problem while handling the request.                                     |



### Summery for Short:
| Range | Meaning       | Simple Analogy                   |
| ----- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1xx   | Informational | “Hang on, I’m working on it.”    |
| 2xx   | Success       | “All good, here’s your result.”  |
| 3xx   | Redirection   | “Go over there instead.”         |
| 4xx   | Client Error  | “Oops, you did something wrong.” |
| 5xx   | Server Error  | “Sorry, I messed up.”            |




## Common HTTP Status Code:
When a web server responds to a request (like when you open a webpage or submit a form), it always sends back a **status code** — a short number that tells you what happened.
Now, here’s the key idea in your sentence:

- **There are a lot of different HTTP status codes**:
  - The official HTTP specification defines many codes (like 200, 404, 500, etc.).
  - Each one describes a specific outcome: success, error, redirect, etc.

- **Applications can even define their own**:
  - Beyond the standard codes, some web apps or APIs create custom codes to handle special cases.
  - Example: An API might use `450 Custom Error` to indicate a unique problem only relevant to that system.

- **We’ll go over the most common HTTP responses**:
  - Even though there are many codes, you’ll mostly encounter a handful in everyday use.
  - These include things like `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `403 Forbidden`, and `500 Internal Server Error`.

| Status Code | Name                  | Meaning / Explanation                                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | OK                    | The request was completed successfully.                                                                   |
| 201         | Created               | A new resource was created (e.g., a new user or blog post).                                               |
| 301         | Moved Permanently     | The page has permanently moved to a new location; browsers and search engines should use the new address. |
| 302         | Found                 | The page has temporarily moved to another location and may change again soon.                             |
| 400         | Bad Request           | The request was incorrect or missing required information.                                                |
| 401         | Not Authorized        | You must log in or provide valid credentials to access this resource.                                     |
| 403         | Forbidden             | You do not have permission to access this resource, even if logged in.                                    |
| 405         | Method Not Allowed    | The HTTP method used is not allowed for this resource (e.g., GET instead of POST).                        |
| 404         | Page Not Found        | The requested page or resource does not exist.                                                            |
| 500         | Internal Server Error | The server encountered an error it cannot properly handle.                                                |
| 503         | Service Unavailable   | The server is currently overloaded or down for maintenance.                                               |

# Task 5: Headers


## Common Request Headers (from client → server)

﻿These are headers that are sent from the client (usually your browser) to the server.
| Header          | Purpose                         | Easy Explanation                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Host            | Identifies the target website   | Tells the server which website you want, since one server can host many sites.                   |
| User-Agent      | Identifies the client browser   | Lets the server know your browser and version so it can adjust the content.                      |
| Content-Length  | Specifies request body size     | Tells the server how much data you’re sending (like form data size).                             |
| Accept-Encoding | Specifies supported compression | Tells the server which compression methods (e.g., gzip) your browser supports to save bandwidth. |
| Cookie          | Sends stored client data        | Sends saved data like login sessions or user preferences back to the server.                     |



## Common Response Headers (from server → client)

These are the headers that are returned to the client from the server after a request.
| Header           | Purpose                      | Easy Explanation                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set-Cookie       | Stores data on the client    | Tells your browser to save data (like a session ID) for future requests.     |
| Cache-Control    | Controls caching behavior    | Defines how long the browser can store a page before it must refresh.        |
| Content-Type     | Identifies data format       | Tells the browser what type of data is being sent (HTML, JSON, image, etc.). |
| Content-Encoding | Describes compression method | Shows how the server compressed the data (gzip, deflate, etc.).              |

## Question & Answer:

### Question 1: What header tells the web server what browser is being used?
<img width="918" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffaea211-c9ac-4466-937e-1143312f90fa" />

- The header tells the web server what browser (and operating system) is being used, is
````
User-Agent
````
**Example**: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)`
<img width="1068" height="81" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb861141-31bd-4356-b5ab-b591412b3491" />


### Question 2: What header tells the browser what type of data is being returned?
<img width="905" height="88" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79df77d4-1258-4a3a-8b7a-865bbc6e5cb9" />


- The header tells the browser what type of data is being returned (e.g., HTML, JSON, plain text), is:
````
Content-Type
````
**Example**: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`
<img width="1059" height="87" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/572ab9e8-5183-42aa-91d1-2f935160af9f" />


### Question 3: What header tells the web server which website is being requested?
<img width="897" height="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfc7a539-4656-4014-8b35-399d426bd917" />

- The header tells the web server which website (domain) is being requested, especially important when multiple sites are hosted on the same server, is:
````
Host
````
**Example**: `Host: www.example.com`
<img width="1065" height="101" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92448231-ab73-41f6-88fa-4d4614b7d238" />



- Now we got successful.

## Task 6: Cookies

### What are cookies?
**Cookies** are small pieces of data stored on our computer (or device) by websites that we visit. They help websites `remember` us, like our **username**, **preferences**, *login status*, or *items in a shopping cart*.

> Important: HTTP is stateless: meaning each request from our browser to a server is independent. Without cookies (or other mechanisms), the server has no idea who you are or what you did before.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 1. Client Requests the Webpage
````
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cookies.thm
User-Agent: xxxx
````
##### What’s happening?
We open our browser and type `http://cookies.thm` (or click a link). Our browser sends a `GET` request to the server asking for the homepage.

##### Server Response:
````
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2021 09:08:19 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

HTML DATA.....
````
The server responds with an HTML page — likely a form that says something like:
````
“Please enter your name: [______]”
````
- This is the first time we’ve visited, so no cookie yet.


#### 2. Client Submits Form (Sends Name)
````
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: cookies.thm
User-Agent: xxxx
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 9

name=adam
````
##### What’s happening?
We filled out the form and typed **adam**, then clicked submit. Our browser sends a `POST` request with the data `name=adam`.

##### Server Response:
````
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2021 09:08:19 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Set-Cookie: name=adam

HTML DATA.....
````
- Key Part: `Set-Cookie: name=adam`

- The server tells our browser:
````
“Hey, please save this piece of data (name=adam) as a cookie. Next time we come back, send it with our request.”
````
Our browser now stores this cookie locally, associated with the domain `cookies.thm`.


#### 3. Client Makes Another Request (Now With Cookie!)
````
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cookies.thm
User-Agent: xxxx
Cookie: name=adam
````
##### What’s happening?
We refresh the page or navigate somewhere else on the site. Our browser automatically includes the cookie it saved earlier: `Cookie: name=adam`.

##### Server Response:
````
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2021 09:08:19 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

<html><body>Welcome back adam</body></html>
````
- The server sees the cookie `name=adam`, recognizes you, and instead of showing the form again, it displays:
````
Welcome back adam
````



### Why Are Cookies Useful?
- **Session Management**: Keep users logged in across pages.
- **Personalization**: Remember preferences (theme, language, etc.).
- **Tracking**: Analyze user behavior (used by ads/analytics).
- **Shopping Carts**: Remember items added even if you leave and return.

> Note: In real applications, cookies usually store a session ID (like session_id=abc123xyz), not sensitive info like passwords or names directly, because cookies can be stolen or viewed.



### Viewing our Own Cookies (Browser Developer Tools)
- The image also explains how to see cookies your browser is sending:

#### Step by step to view our own Cookie
1. Click the `View Site` button at the top right → opens the actual website in your browser.
<img width="921" height="916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42bff714-9343-43ee-8d8f-75579bf86a02" />

- After it will show this:
<img width="1776" height="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f00366-bdcf-40a9-9fd2-fb1f10a0c243" />

2. Open **Developer Tools**:
- Chrome/Firefox/Edge: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac).
- Or `Right-Click` -> `Inspect`.

3. Go to the **Network** tab. Refresh the page click on `load`:
<img width="1918" height="517" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acf23f9c-5279-4feb-9464-7f490e6f22ac" />

- Now we see the cookie.

#### Or we can type command:
- Go To `Console`:
````
document.cookie
````
<img width="1918" height="769" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b2ee283-8c87-4214-ac5d-64e0230347ba" />

- Now we see alots cookie.
