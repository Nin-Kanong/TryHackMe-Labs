# How Website  Work




## Part 1: How Website Work

When you visit a website your browser sends a request to a web server, which responds with the data needed to display the page.
A website has two main parts:

Front end (client-side): what runs in the browser and controls how the page looks and behaves.

Back end (server-side): the server that processes requests and returns responses (data, pages, APIs).

## Part 1: HTML
Websites are primarily created using:
  - HTML, to build websites and define their structure
  - CSS, to make websites look pretty by adding styling options
  - JavaScript, implement complex features on pages using interactivity

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language websites are written in. Elements (also known as tags) are the building blocks of HTML pages and tells the browser how to display content. The code snippet below shows a simple HTML document, the structure of which is the same for every website:
€‹<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>TryHackMe HTML Editor</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hacker</h1>
        <p>How to Hack</p>
        <img src='https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Who-Are-Hackers.png'>
        <img src='https://png.pngtree.com/thumb_back/fh260/background/20241015/pngtree-a-hacker-in-a-hoodie-sitting-at-a-laptop-with-hologram-image_16394239.jpg'>
        <!-- Add dog image here -->
    </body>
</html>

The HTML structure (as shown in the screenshot) has the following components:
  - The <!DOCTYPE html> defines that the page is a HTML5 document. This helps with standardisation across different browsers and tells the browser to use HTML5 to interpret the page.
  - The <html> element is the root element of the HTML page - all other elements come after this element.
  - The <head> element contains information about the page (such as the page title)
  - The <body> element defines the HTML document's body; only content inside of the body is shown in the browser.
  - The <h1> element defines a large heading
  - The <p> element defines a paragraph
  - There are many other elements (tags) used for different purposes. For example, there are tags for buttons (<button>), images (<img>), lists, and much more.

## JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular coding languages in the world and allows pages to become interactive. HTML is used to create the website structure and content, while JavaScript is used to control the functionality of web pages - without JavaScript, a page would not have interactive elements and would always be static. JS can dynamically update the page in real-time, giving functionality to change the style of a button when a particular event on the page occurs (such as when a user clicks a button) or to display moving animations.

JavaScript is added within the page source code and can be either loaded within <script> tags or can be included remotely with the src attribute: <script src="/location/of/javascript_file.js"></script>

The following JavaScript code finds a HTML element on the page with the id of "demo" and changes the element's contents to "Hack the Planet" : document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";

HTML elements can also have events, such as "onclick" or "onhover" that execute JavaScript when the event occurs. The following code changes the text of the element with the demo ID to Button Clicked: <button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Button Clicked";'>Click Me!</button> - onclick events can also be defined inside the JavaScript script tags, and not on elements directly.

## Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when a website doesn't properly protect (or remove) sensitive clear-text information to the end-user; usually found in a site's frontend source code.

We now know that websites are built using many HTML elements (tags), all of which we can see simply by "viewing the page source". A website developer may have forgotten to remove login credentials, hidden links to private parts of the website or other sensitive data shown in HTML or JavaScript.

Sensitive information can be potentially leveraged to further an attacker's access within different parts of a web application. For example, there could be HTML comments with temporary login credentials, and if you viewed the page's source code and found this, you could use these credentials to log in elsewhere on the application (or worse, used to access other backend components of the site).

Whenever you're assessing a web application for security issues, one of the first things you should do is review the page source code to see if you can find any exposed login credentials or hidden links.
