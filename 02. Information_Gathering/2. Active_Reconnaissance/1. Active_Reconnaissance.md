## Task 1: Introduction

- Passive Reconnaissance
  - Involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target.
  - Examples: searching public records, websites, or social media.
  - Goal: collect data quietly, without alerting the target.
- Active Reconnaissance
  - Involves direct engagement with the target system or network.
  - Tools used:
    - **Web browser**: to explore and collect details about the target.
    - **Ping**: checks if a host is reachable and measures response time.
    - **Traceroute**: maps the path packets take to reach the target.
    - **Telnet**: tests connectivity and interacts with services on specific ports.
    - **Netcat (nc)**: versatile tool for probing services, sending data, or opening connections.

### what is Active Reconnaissance?
Active reconnaissance means making direct contact with the target to gather information.
- Methods:
  - Human interaction → phone calls, visits, or social engineering tactics.
  - Technical interaction → connecting to systems (e.g., visiting websites, probing firewalls, checking open ports like SSH)

- Similar to closely inspecting locks and windows on a house — you’re directly testing defenses.

> Active reconnaissance = direct engagement with the target (human or technical), but only with legal approval.

<img width="512" height="512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5b82f85-36f6-46de-9dd2-a91418d5b3dd" />


### Active Reconnaissance
- Active reconnaissance involves making direct connections to the target machine to gather information.

- Logging Impact:
  - Such connections may be recorded in logs, showing details like:
   - Client IP address
   - Time of connection
   - Duration of connection

- Normal vs Suspicious Activity:
  - Not all connections appear suspicious.
  - Example: web browsing blends in with normal user traffic, making reconnaissance harder to detect.

- Red Team Advantage:
  - Attackers (red team) can disguise reconnaissance as regular client activity.
  - This helps avoid detection by defenders (blue team).


> Active reconnaissance = direct engagement with the target, which can leave traces in logs, but clever techniques (like blending in with normal browsing) allow red teams to gather information without raising alarms.



### Active Reconnaissance Tools
- **Web Browser + Developer Tools**:
  - Can be `armed` to gather detailed information about a target website.
  - Useful for inspecting elements, network requests, cookies, and headers.
- **Ping**:
  - Tests connectivity to a host.
  - Reveals if the target is reachable and provides round-trip time.
- **Traceroute**:
  - Maps the path packets take to reach the target.
  - Helps identify intermediate routers and network structure.
- **Telnet**:
  - Connects to specific ports/services.
  - Useful for testing service availability and banner grabbing.

>  These common tools (browser, ping, traceroute, telnet) are simple but powerful for active reconnaissance, since they directly interact with the target system or network.

## Task 2: Web Browser

### Web Browser in Active Reconnaissanc
- Convenience:
  - Browsers are available on all systems and can be used to gather information about a target.

- Transport Level Connections:
  - HTTP → TCP port 80 (default).
  - HTTPS → TCP port 443 (default).
  - Browsers hide these default ports in the address bar.
  - Custom ports can be specified, e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8834/` connects to port 8834 on localhost via HTTPS.

- Developer Tools:
  - Shortcut keys:
    - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + I`
    - **Mac**: `Option + Command + I (⌥ + ⌘ + I)`
  - Available in Firefox, Chrome, and Chromium.
  - Capabilities:
    - Inspect and modify JavaScript files.
    - View and analyze cookies stored on your system.
    - Explore the folder structure of site content.
    - Monitor network requests and responses between browser and server.

> A web browser isn’t just for viewing pages—it can be “armed” with Developer Tools to inspect ports, cookies, scripts, and network traffic, making it a versatile tool for active reconnaissance.

- IF in this I test with tryhackme -> Go to `browser` -> type `tryhackme.com` -> `Ctrl + Shift + I`:

- Open Developer Tools -> `Ctrl + Shift + I`:
<img width="1918" height="777" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af122202-4021-41b5-8416-c59f27edf8e0" />

Now we found `8`:
<img width="1761" height="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2edd811f-63c7-48df-9755-848e1ce01752" />

## Task 3: Ping


### Ping as **Netwok Ping-Pong**:
- Just like in table tennis, when we send the ball (packet) and expect it back.
- If we get a reply, we know the other side is "alive" and reachable.
- If you don’t, either the system is offline, the packet was blocked, or there’s a routing issue.


### Technical Definition
- **Ping command**: Sends an `ICMP Echo Request` packet.
- **Reply**: If the target is online and reachable, it responds with an `ICMP Echo Reply`.
- Conditions for success:
  - Proper routing between source and destination.
  - No firewall blocking ICMP traffic.
  - Target system configured to respond


### Objectives of Ping
- **Connectivity check**: Confirms if two systems can communicate.
- **Availability check**: Determines if a remote host is online.
- **Troubleshooting tool**: Helps isolate network issues (e.g., DNS vs. routing vs. firewall).
- **Pre-scan step**: Ensures the system is reachable before running heavier scans like Nmap for OS detection or service enumeration.

### Different Uses of Ping
- Latency measurement: Round-trip time (RTT) shows how fast packets travel between systems.
- Packet loss detection: Multiple pings can reveal unstable connections.
- Network path testing: Combined with tools like traceroute, ping helps map connectivity issues.
- Monitoring: Automated scripts or tools (like Nagios, Zabbix) use ping to check if servers stay online.


### After Start MAchine:
In this click on **Start Machine**:
<img width="1078" height="848" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76d28ffc-3a85-4ec8-ae23-18c06542dfe1" />

- In this if we not yet to setrup OpenVPN on TryHackMe, Download my **PDF** and following it to connectto Kali:
[OpenVPN_TryHackme.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24353903/OpenVPN_TryHackme.pdf)

- But in this I can't do with OpeNvpn But in this I can't use `ping` with this `IP`:



- So after in this I use with `AtackBox` -> open `Attackbox`:



- After we will see this:
<img width="1919" height="1025" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56e9ca75-96c6-464d-8855-61faf5344693" />


- Open `Terminal` on `Attackbox`:
<img width="955" height="977" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6072b1a8-3131-423b-b7d2-815f7a4d2655" />

Now we got new `Terminal`.
````
ping 10.65.160.194
````
<img width="675" height="303" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c5f6679-3125-42f4-abb2-f06cc1a37215" />

- Runs indefinitely until stopped with CTRL+c


- Or we can `ping` with `Hostname`:
````
ping tryhackme.com
````

- System resolves the hostname to an IP before sending ICMP packets.



#### Send fixed number of packets
````
ping -c 10 10.65.160.194
````
<img width="552" height="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6df0fb-89fc-4253-bbad-0eb0ea50f3ae" />

- Sends 10 packets then stops.




#### Windows
````
ping tryhackme.com
````
<img width="792" height="296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6814766b-d6f2-4490-949a-4da0d76ecbb9" />

- By default, sends `4 packets`.

#### Send fixed number of packets:
````
ping -n 10 10 10.65.160.194
````


- Equivalent to Linux’s `-c`.


### Protocol Details
- **Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**.
- **ICMP types relevant to ping**:
  - `Type 8`: Echo Request (sent by you).
  - `Type 0`: Echo Reply (sent back by target).
- Requirements for success:
  - Target host must be online.
  - ICMP must not be blocked by firewalls or routers.
  - Routing must be correct.





### Ping success case:
- Sent 5 ICMP Echo Requests to the target.
- Received 5 Echo Replies back.
- This confirms the target system is online and reachable.
- Average round-trip time: 0.475 ms, maximum: 0.636 ms → shows low latency and stable connectivity.
- No firewalls or routers blocked ICMP traffic along the path


### Penetration testing perspective:
- Ping is the first step to check if a system is alive.
  - Once confirmed, the next step is to discover:
  - Open ports
   - Running services
   - Operating system details


### Ping failure case:
- After shutting down the target VM, pinging `10.65.160.194` resulted in no replies.
- This indicates the system is offline or not responding to ICMP requests




### What “Destination Host Unreachable” Means
- Our system (AttackBox) tried to send ICMP Echo Requests to `10.65.160.194`.
- No replies came back → 100% packet loss.
- Instead of silence, your own system reports `Destination Host Unreachable`, which indicates:
  - The packet couldn’t even reach the target host.
  - Somewhere along the route, a device (often your own gateway/router) knows the destination is unreachable and sends back this ICMP error.






### No Ping Reply
- Target system is offline
  - Shut down, still booting, or OS crash.
  - Matches your case: VM was powered off.
- Disconnected from the network
  - Target unplugged, cable removed, or faulty switch/router in the path.
- Firewall blocking ICMP
  - Could be host-based (e.g., Windows Firewall blocks ping by default).
  - Could be a network appliance filtering ICMP traffic.
- Your own system/network issue
  - If your AttackBox itself is unplugged or misconfigured, you’ll also see unreachable errors.



> No reply (silent timeout): Packets are sent but dropped somewhere, no response at all.
> Destination Host Unreachable: A device along the path actively tells you the host cannot be reached.

### Question 1: Which option would you use to set the size of the data carried by the ICMP echo request?

<img width="916" height="90" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d02ecdd7-462e-455a-93ba-662a29559b90" />


#### ICMP Echo Request Size:
##### On linux / Unix systems:
- Use `-s` option:
````
ping -s 100 10.65.160.194
````
<img width="586" height="264" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c571f103-0647-446a-aeee-5f885aa1a987" />

##### On windows system:
````
ping -l 100 tryhackme.com
````
<img width="751" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43f4fca2-5db6-4491-98a6-142bead3a785" />

- In this I don't connect VPN with my windows show I test with `tryhackme`.
- This sets the ICMP payload size to `100 bytes` (default is usually 56 bytes, which becomes 64 bytes including the ICMP header).

- Now we found:
````
-s
````
<img width="921" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6a0481d-93fc-49f9-a014-3825c763f8a0" />



### Question 2: What is the size of the ICMP header in bytes?
<img width="914" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b18bdde2-3d91-43d9-9cb8-08ff0dad8903" />

- The ICMP (Internet Message Protocol) header is 8 bytes in size:
​​  - 1 byte for Type
  - 1 byte for Code
  - 2 byte for Checksum
  - 4 byte for Rest of Header (often include fields like identifier and Sequence Number, depending on the ICMP message type)
 
- So we find the correct answer is:
````
Y
````
<img width="1065" height="89" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23410b04-c951-4fb5-9505-f50c1259921c" />



### Question 3: Does MS Windows Firewall block ping by default? (Y/N)
<img width="914" height="95" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d0c5ae1-4bb1-4cf4-93df-c2f403bfbb02" />


- Microsoft Windows Firewall does block incoming ping (ICMP Echo Request) by default for security reasons.

- Now we found the correct answer is:
````
Y
````


> **Note**: This applies to inbound pings from other computers on the network or internet. Outbound pings (e.g., you pinging google.com) are allowed by default. You can allow inbound pings via Windows Defender Firewall rules if needed.



### Question 3: Deploy the VM for this task and using the AttackBox terminal, issue the command ping -c 10 10.65.161.166. How many ping replies did you get back?
<img width="1300" height="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ee5965-8ad0-45a9-add7-da8ddb215ee6" />

- If i ping to my target:
````
ping -c 10 10.65.161.166
````
<img width="816" height="173" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97dbc176-d82e-42e4-a017-002aac0a1628" />

- Now i got `10 packets transmitted` back. and we can use with:
````
10
````
<img width="1062" height="107" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6012d3e0-d253-4e75-bd74-b157d28c72b3" />

- Now we got successful to solve this.


> **Note**: 10.65.161.166 is my target that i start machine.

## Task 4: Traceroute


### What is traceroute?
traceroute shows the path your internet traffic takes from your computer to another device.


### How does it work?
- IT send out little packets with a Time To Live (TTL) value.
- TTL = maximum number of routers (hops) a packet can pass through.
- Each router decreases the TTL by 1.
- When TTL hits 0, the router sends back an error message saying “I dropped this packet.”
- `traceroute` uses that message to learn the router’s IP address.



### Why is it useful?
- Shows how many routers (hops) are between you and the target.
- Reveals each router’s IP address on the path.
- Helps diagnose network problems (e.g., where a connection gets stuck).


### Command 

#### Linux/macOS:
````
traceroute 10.65.161.166
````
<img width="1262" height="774" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8636e74-ba83-4646-9158-b26a18e16682" />


#### Windows
In this my windows `CMD` or `Powershell` with no VPn, so i ping to `tryhackme.com`:
````
tracert tryhackme.com
````
<img width="1062" height="331" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bc47316-d6ba-4e08-acaa-5f86542bc55c" />


> traceroute: maps the route your data takes across the internet by making routers reveal themselves one by one.

<img width="1432" height="1972" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/debaaf0f-c457-4d6f-ac7d-22c1c4ad6128" />


### TTL and ICMP Time Exceeded

- **TTL (Time To Live)** is a field in IP packets that limits how many hops (routers) a packet can travel.
- Each router **decreases TTL by 1**. If TTL becomes `0`, the packet is `discarded`.
- When discarded, the router usually sends back an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message to the sender.
- This helps tools like traceroute map the path of packets.
- Some routers are configured not to send ICMP replies, making them invisible in traceroute.

<img width="1522" height="1360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706f18d1-1a3e-4ca7-84a4-0f4b7b14cfa8" />


### How Traceroute Works on Linux
- **Step 1**: Traceroute sends UDP packets with TTL = 1.
- **Step 2**: The first router decrements TTL → it becomes 0, so the router discards the packet and replies with ICMP Time Exceeded. This reveals the router’s IP.
- **Step 3**: Traceroute then sends another packet with TTL = 2. The second router drops it, sending back its IP.
- **Step 4**: This process repeats, incrementing TTL each time, mapping the path hop by hop.


#### Traceroute A
````
traceroute tryhackme.com
````
<img width="968" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/751a55dc-ca21-44e2-84b0-3ebdbd9aa131" />

- **Hop 1**: 172.20.144.1 (k4n0ng.mshomme.net) is my local gateway/router. Very fast (`~0.3 ms`).
- **Hop 2**: 192.168.100.1 is another local router (Like ISP edge). `~12 ms`.
- **Hop 3** 100.70.31.254 is **ISP** infrastructure router. `~13–15 ms`.
- **- **Hop 4 → * * * **: No response. Router is silent to ICMP, but traffic still flows.
- Hop 5 → 27.111.228.132 (Equinix Singapore) is International transit point. Higher latency (`~65 ms`).
- Hop 6 → Cloudflare routers (162.158.160.165 / 172.69.117.3) is Cloudflare edge servers that protect and route TryHackMe traffic. `~32–34 ms`
- **Hop 7** 172.66.164.239 (TryHackMe server) is Final destination reached. ~26 ms. Confirms connectivity


>  Our packets traveled from your local network → ISP → international gateway → Cloudflare → TryHackMe. Some routers didn’t reply, but the destination was reached successfully.


### How Traceroute Works
- Traceroute sends packets with a **TTL (Time To Live)** value.
- TTL starts small (like 1), then increases step by step (2, 3, 4…).
- Each router (hop) along the path **reduces TTL by 1**.
- When TTL reaches 0, the router says: `I had to drop your packet` and sends back an ICMP Time Exceeded message.
- That reply lets traceroute know **which router** the packet reached.


#### Traceroute B
````
traceroute tryhackme.com
````

### - Traceroute shows the path your packets take from your computer to a target system.
- In your second run, the packets went through 26 routers (hops) — a longer route than before.


### Key Points
1. 	Number of hops can change
  - The internet uses dynamic routing.
  - Routers may choose different paths depending on traffic, load, or network changes.
  - That’s why sometimes we see fewer hops, sometimes more — even if we run traceroute again right away.

2. 	Some routers show their IP address
  - These are visible in the traceroute output.
  - In penetration testing, we might investigate these routers further (if it’s within scope).
  - They give clues about the network path and infrastructure.

3. 	Some routers don’t reply
  - We’ll see  instead of times.
  - This doesn’t mean the packet failed — it just means the router is configured not to respond to ICMP.
  - The packet still moves forward to the next hop.


---


### Questions 1: In Traceroute A, what is the IP address of the last router/hop before reaching tryhackme.com?
<img width="1060" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e52bf479-879a-4088-ac2e-6ce748f1a640" />

- In **Traceroute A**, We ran `traceroute tryhackme.com` Each line shows a router (hop) your packets passed through before reaching the destination.
  - The last hop is always the target host itself (in this case, `tryhackme.com`).
  - The hop just before the target is the last router that forwarded tryhackme packets to the destination.

- In this we need to view on Tryhckme **Traceroute A**:
<img width="1030" height="653" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f843445-73b6-4b12-8cab-3b76df3adc0a" />

````
172.67.69.208
````
<img width="1053" height="88" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7058d41b-f298-422a-b272-da985b1a14c5" />





### Question 2: In Traceroute B, what is the IP address of the last router/hop before reaching tryhackme.com?
<img width="1044" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01a07eb0-2fdc-4350-8c9f-80c590cefd44" />

- In this it the same above we need to view on tryhackme `traceroute tryhackme.com`:
<img width="1032" height="657" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5371547c-0ca2-411e-a691-dd18c82455d8" />

- Now we found the correct answer:
````
104.26.11.229
````
- This mean:
  - It’s the IP address of the destination host, in this case, tryhackme.com.
  - This is the final hop in our traceroute output.
  - It confirms that our packets successfully reached the TryHackMe server, which is protected by Cloudflare

<img width="1045" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c602ff6-fff9-4492-9d41-28ea073533e6" />



### Question 3: In Traceroute B, how many routers are between the two systems?
<img width="1045" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55ab1534-f617-4da4-b32c-74ecfb4fa0c9" />

- We back to view the **traceroute B**:
<img width="1027" height="652" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2660a91f-1587-4103-a9e7-c9b13b38c78b" />

- The traceroute output shows 26 lines total.
- The last line (Hop 26) is the destination server.
- So the number of routers between our system and the target is include all `26`:
````
26
````

## Task 5: Telnet

### What is Telnet?
- **Telnet** = an old protocol (from 1969) used to connect to another computer’s command line remotely.
- **Default port**: 23.
- **Problem**: It sends everything (including usernames and passwords) in cleartext → unsafe because attackers can easily steal credentials.
- **Secure alternative**: SSH (Secure Shell), which encrypts the communication.

### ther Uses of Telnet
Even though Telnet is insecure for administration, the Telnet client is still useful for testing because:
- It works with TCP connections.
- We can connect to any service running on TCP, not just Telnet servers.
- Example: We can connect to a web server on port 80 and “talk” to it directly.


### Connecting to a Web Server
- In this i test with my Metasploitable v2 IP `192.168.127.129`:
<img width="943" height="627" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e315e2-af90-485c-946e-8faa71bb2e32" />


- After on my attacker (kali):
````
nmap -sV -T4 192.168.127.129
````
<img width="1492" height="805" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c890fd0-8a81-4feb-959a-c83dac4d8ffa" />

- Now i see our target was open port 23 `Telnet`, After i access to this port:
````
telnet 192.168.127.129 23
````
<img width="1147" height="1042" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f458839-5c91-4486-82dd-68f15990abab" />

````
Username: msfadmin
Password: msfadmin
````

### Question 1: Start the attached VM from Task 3 if it is not already started. On the AttackBox, open the terminal and use the telnet client to connect to the VM on port 80. What is the name of the running server?
<img width="1052" height="113" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e1628f-fb87-49b8-abf8-464a78bf4e50" />

- Open attackbox:
<img width="1087" height="832" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceab2eb7-919f-4dda-83dd-a3933ae2b96f" />

- After use `telnet`:
````
telnet 10.66.168.155 80
````
<img width="619" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebde0f3-c2b7-49e1-8a9c-21949eeec85e" />

- `10.66.168.155` is IP of Lab.
- But in this I can't use it.
- IF we type command like above we will see:
````
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2026 09:10:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.61 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
````
- So we found `Apache` is the name server.
<img width="912" height="108" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18cf01bd-c359-4268-b588-76e2c1cf9fd0" />

### Question 2: What is the version of the running server (on port 80 of the VM)?
<img width="930" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3e7c4ee-bdb0-4605-9bdf-93530c892a56" />

- So in we found the name server above it will come with version of server `Server: Apache/2.4.61 (Ubuntu)`:
````
2.4.61
````
<img width="893" height="98" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb114715-32d0-4e80-9b72-f059a95cbf98" />

- Now we got successful.

## Task 5: Netcat
### What is **Netcat** 
- **Swiss Army knife of networking**: Netcat can act as both a client (connecting to a port) and a server (listening on a port).
- **Protocols supported**: TCP and UDP.



### Why use **Netcat** instead of Telnet
- Telnet is old and limited - it only works as a client and mainly for TCP.
- **Netcat** is more versatile:
  - Can connect to any port (like Telnet). 
  - Can listen on a port (acting as a server).
  - Can handle both TCP and UDP.
  - Can be scripted and automated easily.
 



### Banner Grabbing with Netcat
Banner grabbing means connecting to a service and reading its initial response (the `banner`), which often reveals the software name and version.

#### Connect to the server:
````
nc 10.66.168.155 80
````
- Output will show:
````
           
pentester@TryHackMe$ nc 10.66.168.155 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: netcat

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.6.2
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 2021 11:39:49 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 867
Last-Modified: Tue, 17 Aug 2021 11:12:16 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "611b9990-363"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
````





### Using Netcat to Connect
1. Connect to a server
````
nc 10.65.141.231 80
````
- Opens a TCP connection to IP 10.65.141.231 on port 80.


2. Send an HTTP request manually
````
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: netcat
````
- Requests the default page (`/`) using HTTP/1.1.
- The `Host`: line is required in HTTP/1.1, but the name can be anything here.

3. Read the response
The server replies with headers like:
````
Server: nginx/1.6.2
````
- This tells you the web server is `Nginx version 1.6.2` running on port 80.


### Using Netcat to listen

1. Open a port on your machine
````
nc -lp 1234
````
- Listens on port `1234`.


2. Better version with options
````
nc -vnlp 1234
````
- `-v` = verbose (show connection info)
- `-n` = no DNS lookups (use raw IPs)
- `-l` = listen mode
- `-p 1234` = port number

- - Flags can be in any order, but the port must follow `-p`.

3. Connect from another system
````
nc <server-IP> 1234
````
Now both sides can type messages back and forth, like a simple chat.



| Option | Meaning                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-l`   | Listen mode                                            |
| `-p`   | Specify the port number                                |
| `-n`   | Numeric only; no resolution of hostnames via DNS       |
| `-v`   | Verbose output (optional, useful for discovering bugs) |
| `-vv`  | Very verbose output (optional)                         |
| `-k`   | Keep listening after client disconnects                |



### Server Side (the machine that listens
- To make your computer listen on a port, use:
````
nc -vnlp 1234
````
- Options explained:
  - `-v`: verbose (shows connection info).
  - `-n`: no DNS lookups (avoids warnings).
  - `-l`: listen mode (acts like a server).
  - `-p 1234`: port number (here, 1234).
> Ports below 1024 require root privileges, so use higher ports like 1234 for practice.



### Client Side (the machine that connects
- To connect to the server, use:
````
nc 10.65.141.231 1234
````
- Replace `10.65.141.231` with the server’s IP address, and `1234` with the port it’s listening on.

### Question 1: Start the VM and open the AttackBox. Once the AttackBox loads, use Netcat to connect to the VM port 21. What is the version of the running server?
<img width="1025" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39833592-fa5a-46db-a5c8-de1fa3d9d951" />

 
- Port 21 is the default port for **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**.
````
nc 10.65.141.231 21
````
<img width="682" height="72" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52923b30-cd8a-406f-8913-99003c81f44c" />

- Now we found `Linux‑ftpd version 0.17 (OpenBSD)`, so it running on 
````
Service: FTP
Software: Linux‑ftpd
Version: 0.17
````
- Now we found the correct answer is:
````
0.17
````
<img width="1026" height="99" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/195031ba-94a4-4647-94d0-f574ffe47d7c" />

- Now we got succeed.

## Putting It All Together

Tools Mentioned
-  **Traceroute**
  - Shows the path your packets take through the network to reach a target.
  - Useful for mapping routers and hops between you and the destination.
- **Ping**
  - Sends an ICMP Echo request to check if a system is alive and responding.
  - If you get replies, the target is reachable.
- **Telnet**
  - Can attempt to connect to a specific port (like 21 for FTP, 80 for HTTP).
  - If the connection succeeds, that port is open and listening.
  - If it fails, the port is closed or blocked.


| Command           | Example                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ping`            | `ping -c 10 10.65.141.231` (Linux / macOS) |
| `ping`            | `ping -n 10 10.65.141.231` (MS Windows)    |
| `traceroute`      | `traceroute 10.65.141.231` (Linux / macOS) |
| `tracert`         | `tracert 10.65.141.231` (MS Windows)       |
| `telnet`          | `telnet 10.65.141.231 PORT_NUMBER`         |
| `netcat (client)` | `nc 10.65.141.231 PORT_NUMBER`             |
| `netcat (server)` | `nc -lvnp PORT_NUMBER`                     |


### Fundamental Tools
- Tools like ping, traceroute, telnet, and netcat are basic but powerful.
- They’re available on most operating systems, so you can quickly test connectivity, map routes, and check open ports.


### Web Browser as a Recon Tool
- Every computer and smartphone has a browser.
- Browsers can be used for reconnaissance (information gathering) without raising alarms because browsing is normal activity.
- Example:
  - Viewing headers with Developer Tools.
  - Inspecting page source.
  - Checking cookies, requests, and responses.
  - Observing how a web app communicates with its server.

### Developer Tools
- Built into browsers (like Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools).
- Allow you to:
  - Inspect HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
  - Monitor network requests.
  - See server responses and headers.
  - Debug scripts and analyze performance.
- These tools give deeper insight into how applications work behind the scenes.

| Operating System   | Developer Tools Shortcut |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Linux / MS Windows | `Ctrl + Shift + I`       |
| macOS              | `Option + Command + I`   |
